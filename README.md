#iBeacon Storefront Greeter in Swift

You can find Xcode projects containing the customer and storefront applications shown in this tutorial's video [on my github][1].

This tutorial assumes the reader has basic knowledge of Apple's iBeacon protocol and its specifications. For an introductory tutorial to iBeacons, see the [Smart iBeacon][2] post.

Every morning on the way to work, I grab a latte from a coffee shop near my apartment. The baristas know me by name, and they know my usual order. It would be awesome if everywhere people shopped, they were treated as an individual instead of "just another customer". However, it is difficult for an employee (say, a barista) to remember the names of the hundreds of people they interact with on a daily basis.

Thus, we came up with a solution using Apple's iBeacon protocol and PubNub's data streaming network. In this tutorial, we will build a greeter application. Its primary functionality is to let a shopkeeper know when a customer enters the store and provide the shopkeeper with a little bit of information about the customer. This information allows the shopkeeper to personalize and improve the customer's experience.
